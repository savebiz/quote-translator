# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Current Setup
- Favicon is currently referenced from `/src/favicon.svg`
- For better performance, favicons should be in the `public` directory

## To Add Your New Favicon

1. **Prepare Your Image**
   - Convert your image to favicon format
   - Best formats: `.ico`, `.png`, or `.svg`
   - Recommended sizes: 32x32, 16x16, or scalable SVG

2. **Place the File**
   - Save your favicon file as `favicon.ico` or `favicon.png` in the `public` directory
   - Or keep it as SVG if it's vector-based

3. **Update index.html**
   - The favicon link will be updated to point to `/favicon.ico` (or your chosen format)

## Quick Setup

If you have the image file ready:
1. Place it in the `public` folder as `favicon.ico` (or `favicon.png`/`favicon.svg`)
2. I'll update the `index.html` to reference it

## Image Description
Based on your description, the favicon features:
- Abstract minimalist design
- White lines forming interconnected structure
- Vibrant gradient circle (magenta to purple)
- Black background

This sounds perfect for a modern dApp favicon!
